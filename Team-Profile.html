In summary, Trangâ€™s dream job was security manager, Khiemâ€™s was mobile software engineer, Huyâ€™s was project manager, ThÆ°â€™s was business analyst and mine was C++ Developer. None of our career plans is the same because of the difference in each personâ€™s personality and skills. Trang and Huy both want to be a manager but in different fields as one is invested more on security whilst the other is fond of taking care of the whole project. Khiem loves playing video games, that is why it is easily understandable that he would like to have a career in the mobile app market. ThÆ° has always shown affection towards data and business. More than once she has displayed her interest in having a business of her own. For that reason, I believe becoming a business analyst is most suitable for her. For my part, I have been drawn to like a programming language called C++ from the first time I was introduced to it. The language is not easy to handle, specifically for someone who is a slow learner like me. However, challenges are what make you grow and I believe that the process will make me develop better as a programmer. All in all, despite having diverse ideal jobs in the technology field, there is one thing we have in common, which is passion and hard-work.&nbsp;</b>

        <h6 class="u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2"><b style="">Hi! I am Thu - an eighteen-year-old junior at RMIT. This is my first project at RMIT. My favorite thing about IT is being able to instantly see the changes I make to the code in a hands-on manner rather than just on the screen. Previously I was a CAD designer and constructor in the Robotic (FRC) and Rocketry (TARC) team in high school. Though I did not have a profound background in programming, I was hooked as a sophomore that learned how the team project works using GitHub. I started self-learning programming then. I put plans into action at the time I figured the general idea through a top-down process. For instance, as the practical database project began, I conceptualized ideas, executed time, and initiated the project's structure to have a productive meeting and planning. Therefore, my team members need to perceive a high level of fit between their values and the group's values overall, which is achieving a high practical project and HD. Besides, I would assist technicians; I could identify how infrastructure needs to change to streamline business and IT operations.</b>

        <h6 class="u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2"><b>I have a burning desire for soccer. I can spend hours watching my favorite team, Manchester United, play back to back without ever getting tired. The more I watch them, the more I admire the passion and enthusiasm in their playing. Besides soccer, I also love traveling to places around the world. The most memorable trip in my life was to the US. If I have the chance, I would definitely choose to go back to NYC and spend another night at the Trump Tower. Those two activities were what I thought my most favorites in the world, until I accidentally stepped foot into the technology field. After watching videos on YouTube, I became more and more curious about how to build a PC, then advanced vehicles, then AI, and finally I decided to take IT as my major. By coming to RMIT, I know that its international environment and high quality education will increase my employability.</b>

        <h6 class="u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2"><b>Like most of the girls, I never thought I would study IT. Back before, I spent most of my time baking and dancing, which are my two biggest passions, instead of learning about technology or writing codes. To be honest, I was not really interested in the field itself, but the benefits and amazing things it has achieved. Having knowledge about technology plays an essential role in the 4.0 world we are living in. Not only can it make our lives more convenient, but also help us to have a better job, a brighter future, and contribute greater things to society. Those are the reasons why I chose IT as my major and which motivate me when I feel like giving up. Before starting a new journey at RMIT, I just had a little experience in this field like pascal and some basic computer tools. However, I am quite a fast learner. Because of it, I have confidence to challenge myself with IT, which is something I and the people around me never expected.</b>

However, coming to RMIT, I have gotten a chance to meet up with a lot of people and their hospitality has made my journey become much easier. In my leisure time, I mostly watch series and movies. Some of my favorites genres are thriller, mystery, action and rom-com. Besides that, I also love music and everything that comes with it, for example, listening to songs, writing lyrics and playing instruments. When I decided to choose IT as my major, I was a complete newbie with neither experience nor knowledge. But as time goes by, I have grown to love and enjoy every bit of my journey in RMIT and I am confident that I can follow it until the end.</b>

Hence, I decided to choose IT as my major and RMIT as my destination. Besides IT, I am also keen on commercial production. Iâ€™d love to see behind the scene videos on how each movie or advertisement are made, to know about the processes and the challenges after the completed scenes. I have some basic knowledge about coding. I used to study in Code.org, Khan Academy, Scratch and Python Online. All of these had helped prepare me for my studying progress in RMIT and even now, I still use them for self-teaching purposes.</b>
