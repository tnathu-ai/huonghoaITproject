From my perspective, our team has worked hard from the very beginning, especially at the time close to the deadline, where everyone pulled up 101% of their power. Here are some of my thought on each member’s performance:Nguyen Hai Minh Trang: Trang always shows enthusiasm and confidence about our project. She is passionate, flexible and also intelligent. In fact, Trang was the one who came up with the idea of our presentation. Sometimes she even stayed up until 3 AM to finish her part and it shows her determination. Whenever there is something she does not understand, she takes no hesitation in digging deeper into the problems until the results that she wants are out. Overall, I am very happy to be a part of the team with her.Tran Anh Thu: Thu is a sweet and thoughtful person. She deals with problems in a light way instead of taking things in a serious manner, and it helps create a comfortable atmosphere for our group. Aside from that, she is also very responsible with work. She would take charge of the group’s process and push the members to do their best so that we don’t fall behind.</b>

Similar to Thu, Huy never hesitates when it comes to helping other members or willing to undertake harder parts. Although he is a hard working student, sometimes he still submit his parts later than our group’s due date. However, I can understand and sympathize with him since he has to study 4 courses this semester.Min Chi Gia Khiem: Among five members, Khiem is the less talkative one. Although he did not often join our communication, he always attends our meetings and completes his tasks on time. I just wish he could be more enthusiastic and contribute more to his opinion when we discuss something.Phan Do Ngoc Linh: Linh is a funny girl who always makes our meetings become more funny and less tired with her interesting ideas. Like other members, she is also hard-working and finishes her tasks on time, which I am really pleased about. However, sometimes she is quite distracted in our discussions.Nguyen Hai Minh Trang (me): In my opinion, I have completed my tasks quite well and on time.

From that, I was able to have a close look at each person’s performance. Overall, I am very satisfied with our team’s and each member’s progress. We always made it in time for the deadlines despite having busy schedules. Even when problems arised, we did not hold vicious thoughts against one another, but rather face the issues vis-à-vis. Because of it, there weren’t any serious misunderstandings in our team, so the atmosphere was always straight forward and enjoyable. However, there is one thing that I feel like could be improved, which is the content in our meetings. From time to time we would meet up and talk about what we should do next. But sometimes, we got distracted in the middle of it and ended up going nowhere. Even though this did not happen all the time, it could still have a negative effect on our project, like late submission for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;During our time working together, one thing that surprised me the most was the fact that everything went really well despite each member having their own opinions. Usually when it comes to teamwork, it is expected that all members have the same mindset and viewpoint in order to head in the right direction. When I first met my team, it was clear from the beginning that we had very contrasting ideas. However, once we were past that, everyone got along and worked smoothly.Being able to participate in a wonderful team, I have learned so much from my teammates that will definitely help me in the future. Take Huy for example. Huy took 4 courses this semester, which means he had more deadlines, more assignments than the others. However, he never refused to work and always did his parts properly. He was a role model and a responsible teammate as well. From him, I learned how to be flexible on my timetable so that I could do many things at the same time without feeling overwhelmed.</b>

In all circumstances, I have attempted to consummate my tasks and not upset others. That implies that I cautiously research the data so I can add more to my work. To lay it out plainly, I am a person fulfilling my role. One thing I need to improve my work routine. I invest a great deal of energy finishing my tasks and it's an excess of now and then. I need to figure out how to control my time so I can accelerate my work with the goal that I don't influence others. At the point when the advancement of the work is pushed up, others will feel greater when my part is prepared and give them a wellspring of inspiration for them to accelerate to find what I am doing. I was amazed when I first accepted the role of doing the assigned tasks however turned into the chosen one and it was an incredible experience. Last but not least, what I gained from working in a group is to try not to purchase quick nourishments like snacks as it can cause us to feel lethargic.&nbsp;With regards to teaming, it is hard to manage everything well, except my group has worked viably together. While doing this, everybody will be upbeat and lift profitability. As an outcome, we made some great memories working and we upheld each other well indeed. Nonetheless, I feel that the speed of the working process has not been compelling. Everybody should begin working early instead of postponing time, as it puts a strain on us as the cutoff time approaches and we will feel in a rush to cooperate. Furthermore, when meeting, everybody should concentrate more, don't be occupied by the encompassing issues just as a spotlight on the gathering's work and associate with everybody. What I'm glad about working with this group is that even though things are late, everybody is urging each other to work out the best. At the point when everybody concurs this way, cooperating will be extremely snappy and successful. The uplifting statements from everybody are the main impetus for all to have the option to accomplish the best work and the outcomes are because of the endeavors of every individual. Besides, the calmness when working is also a strong point to mention, we calmly work together despite time is very fast, it is the calmness that makes each person more confident in the section. do their own and contribute to the overall achievement of the group. On the contrary, the thing my group needs to improve the most is self-awareness. We have to be self-conscious to increase the work progress as well as the working time. Only when there is a push from the other members or a deadline can my team focus on the assigned assignment and get it done. If everyone had self-discipline before, everything would have been extremely smooth and brisk, it was not close to the cutoff time to begin finding out about it. This will be a great lesson for everybody in the group and me. Sometime later, I will give myself mindfulness so I can work with everybody and uphold each other to create.&nbsp;</b>
